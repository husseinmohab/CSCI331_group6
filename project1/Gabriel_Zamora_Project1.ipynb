I did this by by going through the Production.WorkOrder table, where every unit is built, and every unit is scrapped. From there, i linked each work order to its matching entry in Production.Product to reveal which parts were responsible for the biggest messes on the factory floor. I then computed the ScrapRate by dividing the Scrapped Quantity by the order quantity, and nulled any orders that couldnt be measured. Then i grouped everything by product and took the average rate to find which items consistently performed the worst, ignoring the small jobs.</span>"
