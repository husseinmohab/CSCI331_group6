T-SQL CREATE TYPE  & ANSI CREATE DOMAIN

Both used to create user defined data types (aliases)

CREATE DOMAIN

* ANSI standard for user defined types.
* Bundles a base type (e.g., VARCHAR(10)) with constraints (CHECK, NOT NULL) and a DEFAULT value into one object. 

CREATE DOMAIN US_POSTAL_CODE AS CHAR(5)
CHECK (VALUE ~ '^[0-9]{5}$');

CREATE TABLE Addresses (
  ZipCode US_POSTAL_CODE NOT NULL -- Inherits type and CHECK
);

CREATE TYPE

* T-SQL equivalent  
CREATE TYPE SocialSecurityNumber FROM CHAR(11);


User Defined Data Types (Domains)

* Data Consistency
    * Ensures data is stored identically (e.g. all EmailAddress columns share the same VARCHARlength and validation).
    * Stops differing definitions for the same data (e.g., one dev uses VARCHAR(100), another NVARCHAR(255)).
* Reusability
    * Define complex types (e.g. PhoneNumber, SKU, CurrencyAmount) once.
    * Developers use the PhoneNumber type without needing to look up or re-implement its logic.
*  Governance
    * Single point of truth, the type becomes the business definition for that data element.
    * If a business rule changes (e.g. ProductID format expands), update the central type, not 50+ individual columns.
    * More descriptive. ZipCode US_POSTAL_CODE is much clearer than ZipCode CHAR(5).

Fully Qualified Table Names (FQTN)

* [DatabaseName].[SchemaName].[TableName] (e.g., [ProdData].[Sales].[Orders])
* Clarity & Unambiguity:
    * Eliminates ambiguity. SELECT * FROM ProdData.Sales.Orders is explicit; SELECT * FROM Orders relies on the user's default database/schema context.
    * Prevents scripts and stored procedures from breaking when run by different users or from different database contexts.
* Referential Integrity & Joins:
    * Guarantees JOIN operations connect to the correct tables, which is critical in complex schemas (e.g. Sales.Orders vs. Archive.Orders).
    * FQTNs are mandatory when writing queries that join tables from different databases.
* Scalability & Heterogeneous Environments:
    * As an environment grows (reporting, staging, prod DBs), FQTNs are the only reliable way to target specific tables.
    * Required for querying across different database systems via Linked Servers (e.g., [MyOracleLink].[Catalog].[Schema].[Table]).
